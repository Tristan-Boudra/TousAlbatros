# What's TousAlbatros ?

All Albatros, it is first of all the story of three women who join forces to create a method combining their different specialties: social support, socio-educational animation and coaching. Because building one’s future involves understanding one’s own history, Tous Albatros designs projects to give young people the keys to introspection and projection. The association uses all the tools necessary for the development of self-determination, vitality and the ability to act of adolescents. Every Albatross has a potential waiting to be revealed!
